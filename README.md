My personal repository 
   My name Akinlabi Alexander.I was born in a small town called Ife North, Osun state, Nigeria. I graduated from 
 secondary school in the year 2021. One thing about me that is important to know is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and they are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, it is great and I am all different. Academically I am a student who enjoys both hands on projects as well as conventional learning. I am an enthusiatic science student and I also enjoy solving maths questions.
